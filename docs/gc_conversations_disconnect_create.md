## gc conversations disconnect create

Performs a full conversation teardown. Issues disconnect requests for any connected media. Applies a system wrap-up code to any participants that are pending wrap-up. This is not intended to be the normal way of ending interactions but is available in the event of problems with the application to allow a resynchronization of state across all components. It is recommended that users submit a support case if they are relying on this endpoint systematically as there is likely something that needs investigation.
